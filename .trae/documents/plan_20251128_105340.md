# Fix Missing User Import in Models API

## Issue Analysis
The error message `NameError: name 'get_db' is not defined` in `models.py` is misleading. The actual issue is that the `User` class is being used as a type annotation in the route functions, but it's not imported.

## Root Cause
In `backend/app/api/models.py`, line 11 uses `User` as a type annotation for the `current_user` parameter, but there's no import statement for `User` from `app.models.user`.

## Fix Plan
1. **Add Missing Import**: Add `from app.models.user import User` to `backend/app/api/models.py`
2. **Verify Pattern Consistency**: Ensure all API files follow the same import pattern
3. **Test the Fix**: Run the backend server to confirm the issue is resolved

## Expected Outcome
- The backend server should start successfully without the NameError
- All API endpoints should function correctly
- The code should follow consistent import patterns across all API files
